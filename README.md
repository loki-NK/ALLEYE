# ALLEYE
In this we have developed a Tag and Track system which will lock on to the target based on its color and the mechanical unit will be aligned in the direction of target.
Open CV is used for image processing.
the system is designed to track four colors: Red,Green,Yellow,Blue.
User will be one selecting color by pressing 'R'-Red,'G'-Green,'Y'-yellow,'B'-Blue and once target is pointed correctly then you can press 'F'-Fire button and light the laser mounted on the mechanical unit to give confirmation that target is pointing correctly.
